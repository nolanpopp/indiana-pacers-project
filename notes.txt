TO DO:

Find undervalued player



==== IN 1.2 and 1.3 Analysis: ====

Why did you use a different defensive composite score for both rating scales target vs undervalued?

For established rotation players (20+ MPG), we include plus/minus in our composite score because there's enough data for it to be meaningful. 
For undervalued players with limited minutes, we focus purely on their defensive skills—rebounds, steals, 
and blocks—since these translate regardless of lineup context and aren't as affected by small sample noise.


In 1.3 Analysis:

- Almost made mistake with De'Andre Hunter being the most undervalued player. Got weird warning saying Hunter was appearing twice due to my debugging print statement warnings
in the comparison function. Found out it was because it was only keeping track of half his season stats because of a mid season trade. Fixed code in the pipeline to now 
account for midseason trades.

Debug code: 

# Check what's in nba_analysis for De'Andre Hunter
nba_analysis %>% 
  filter(athlete_display_name == "De'Andre Hunter") %>%
  select(athlete_display_name, team_abbreviation, games, avg_minutes)
